### Backend systems engineer with a security mindset

Security Engineer @ [Checkmarx](https://checkmarx.com/).  
I design and build distributed backend systems, with an emphasis on resilience, observability and maintainability — and I apply offensive security thinking to improve software safety.

Outside of work I operate a self-hosted home lab as a playground for systems design, service orchestration, and security experimentation.
