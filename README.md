## Hi there 👋
I'm João, a software engineer focused on building distributed, modular backend systems. I’m passionate about crafting clean architectures, solving hard problems, and designing resilient solutions. Currently a Security Engineer at Checkmarx, I blend backend engineering with a deep interest in cybersecurity. Outside work, I run a home lab to host services for friends and family, a playground for system administration and security experimentation as well as the need for availability, integrity and confidentiality.

### Current Focus
- **Backend Design & Development**
- **Systems' Design and Patterns**
- **Application Security and finding vulnerabilities in software**
- **CyberSecurity in general**
- **Reverse Engineering**
- **Home Server/Lab Enthusiast**
